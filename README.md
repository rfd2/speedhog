A DIY road traffic data management system

Influenced by: https://www.hackster.io/hodgestk/traffic-camera-9d3739

Speedhog has a few objectives - here they are in order of increasing complexity (and decreasing likelihood of being fully developed)
* Serve as a system-of-record for vehicle traffic data captured from private citizen installations such as the one described in the hackster.io article linked above
* Provide data visualization and analysis tools for traffic data
* Build a negative reinforcement system - referred to as the *weekly hog* - that will highlight top offending vehicles 
* Employ a positive reinforcement system for specific neighborhoods with speeding & reckless driving problems (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iynzHWwJXaA))
* Explore machine learning & AI capabilities to uniquely identify vehicles operating in an unsafe manner
